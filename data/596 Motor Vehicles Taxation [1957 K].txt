598 Motor Vehicles Taxation [1957: KAR. ACT 35
STATEMENTS OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
I
Act 35 of 1957.- With the reorganisation of the States on the 1st November
1956, the several laws dealing with levy of taxes and tolls on motor vehicles in force
are being continued to be administered in the several integrating areas. The present
Bill is intended to bring into being a uniform rate structure throughout the new
Mysore State. The Bill is prepared keeping in view the relevant provisions contained
in the respective laws in force in the integrated areas. The salient features of the Bill
are:
1. Abolition of tools.
2. Total exemption from payment of taxes on motor vehicles used solely for
agricultural purposes.
3. Prohibiting local bodies from levying taxes or tools on motor vehicles and
providing for payment of compensation for loss of such income.
(Obtained from L.A. Bill No. 5489 dated 17-6-1957)
II
Amending Act 29 of 1958.— Not available
III
Amending Act 34 of 1962.—The Existing rates of taxes on vehicles were fixed
in the year 1957. Since then there has been a steady rise in the cost of construction
and maintenance of roads and the administrative expenditure. Further, due to the
tempo of the Third Five-Year Plan, additional resources have to be found for
meeting the increased expenditure that has to be incurred to fulfill the financial and
physical targets fixed under the Plan. It is therefore proposed to increase the rate of
taxation under the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, keeping in view the rates prevailing
in the neighbouring States.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A, dated
4-12-1962, as No. 242 ,at page 9.)
IV
Amending Act 23 of 1965.—1. It is considered necessary that for the effective
implementation of the Fourth Five-Year Plan ways and means for the additional
resources have to be devised for meeting the increased expenditure that has to be
incurred to fulfill the financial and physical targets fixed to be completed and hence
the levy of increased rates of taxes in respect of goods vehicles is inevitable.
2. The rates of levy of motor vehicles taxes in respect of goods vehicles of
certain laden weight prevailing in Madras State are slightly higher than those
prevailing in Mysore State. The rates of tax now sought to be increased on goods
vehicles will be on part with the rates of taxes prevailing in Madras State. The
intention to increase the rates of tax in respect of certain vehicles of higher laden
weight is to increase the Government revenue. The estimated additional income
from this increase is likely to be about 23 lakhs per annum.

(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A, dated
16-10-1965, as No. 201, at page 6.)
V
Amending Act 33 of 1966.— In order to raise additional revenues for the
implementation of the Fourth Five Year Plan, it is proposed to increase the rates of
tax levied on goods vehicles and motor cars. hence this Bill.
The estimated additional income from this increase may come up to Rs.18 lakhs
per annum.
(Obtained from L.A. Bill No.38 of 1966 Page No.4).
VI
Amending Act 16 of 1971.—In order to raise additional resources to be utilised
exclusively for the relief of Bangla Desh refugees, the Government of Mysore has
proposed to enhance the existing tax by ten percent under the Mysore Motor
Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957, payable in respect of all motor vehicles other than
passengers and goods vehicles plying on hire. The present measure is being
enacted to give effect to the said proposal.
2. The Committee constituted under the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 3 of
the Mysore State Legislature (Delegation of Powers) Act, 1971 (23 of 1971), has
been consulted before enactment of this measures as a President’s Act.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A, dated
30-11-1971, at page 5.)
VII
Amending Act 6 of 1972.—In order to raise additional resources it is proposed
to increase the existing rate of tax in respect of motor vehicles for which contract
carriage permits are issued and which are permitted to carry more than five
persons.
Hence the Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A, dated
20-7-1972, as No. 288, at page 63.)
VIII
Amending Act 16 of 1974.—It is proposed to raise the rates of taxation on
Motor Cycles (including Motor Scooters) and Motor Vehicles and Motor Cars other
than those used for plying for hire and transport of passengers, in order to augment
the revenues of the State.
Hence the Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A dated
21-3-1974, as No. 564, at page 3.)
IX
600 Motor Vehicles Taxation [1957: KAR. ACT 35
Amending Act 14 of 1975.—In order to improve and develop roads and bridges
in the Karnataka State it is proposed to raise funds by levy of surcharges on all
Motor Vehicles kept for use in the State.
Hence the Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A dated
29-3-1975, as No. 868, at page 4.)
X
Amending Act 38 of 1976.—1. At present two kinds of taxes are being collected
on Motor Vehicles. One is under the provisions of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles
Taxation Act, 1957 and the other is under the provisions of the Karnataka Motor
Vehicles (Taxation on Passengers and Goods) Act, 1961. In the case of the latter,
the method of assessment is either to obtain the returns from the operators and to
assess the tax or collect the tax at the rates of composition provided for under the
Schedule to the Act.
2. By experience it has been found that there is a quite good deal of leakage of
revenue by way of tax on passengers and goods as in many cases the operators
either submit incorrect returns or fail to compound the tax and pay the same. The
method of assessment is also cumbersome and unnecessarily adds to the work.
3. It is therefore considered necessary to have one enactment only so that levy
and collections are better ensured.
4. The expression “kept in the State of Karnataka” occurring in the existing
enactment is hampering the collection from motor vehicles registered in other
States and passing through Karnataka State to some other States. It is difficult to
establish in a court of law that such motor vehicles are kept for use in Karnataka
State. It is proposed to obviate this.
5. Having regard to the convenience to the public the following provisions are
proposed:
(i) to replace the tax licences by taxation cards;
(ii) to redefine the “year” as financial year in relation to fleet owners and in
other cases, the period of twelve calender months, commencing from the first day of
the month in which a motor vehicle is registered or a new registration mark is
assigned under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939;
(iii) to redesignate the licensing authority as taxation authority;
(iv) to provide for payment of tax annually in the case of motor vehicles for
which the total tax per year does not exceed three hundred rupees;
(v) to specify in the Act the grace period of 10 days for payment of tax in
respect of all vehicles; and
(vi) certain other consequential amendments.

6. Besides, this will relieve the public of much inconveniences experienced by
them due to heavy rush in the office, of the Regional Transport Officers during the
tax collection seasons.
7. Opportunity is also taken to provide for—
(i) collection of tax escaping payment;
(ii) payment of tax in instalments by fleet owners;
(iii) carriage of tax free taxation card by vehicles exempted from payment of
tax;
(iv) seizure and detention of motor vehicles plying without payment of taxes;
(v) a separate provision for composition of offences;
(vi) trial of offences under the Act by the Magistrate not lower in rank than a
Judicial First Class Magistrate;
(vii) exercise of revisional powers by the Transport Commissioner in certain
cases.
Hence the Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A, dated
24-3-1976, as No. 1615, at page 20–21.)
XI
Amending Act 19 of 1978.—The Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act was
amended by the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation (Amendment) Act, 1972
(Karnataka Act No. 6 of 1972). By this amendment the tax payable in respect of
contract carriages was enhanced from Rs. 35/- to Rs. 100/- per seat per quarter
with effect from 1st July 1972. Aggrieved by this enhancement, Industrial
Undertakings like M/s. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd., Indian Telephone Industries and
Hindustan Machine Tools challenged the validity of the classification of their
vehicles as contract carriages used for transporting employees to and from their
places/of residence to the factory and levy of the tax based on such classification.
Their writ appeals were allowed by the High Court and it was held that these
vehicles of Industrial Undertaking used for the transportation of their employees
were not contract carriages within the meaning of the provision of the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1939 and the special leave application filed by the State Government
before the Supreme Court was dismissed on 14th April 1976. Based on the decision
of the High Court, the above three Industrial Undertakings have applied to
Government for classification of their vehicles as contract carriages chargeable at
Rs. 35/- per seat per quarter and to refund the difference of tax collected from them
in respect of their vehicles. The claims of M/s. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd., comes to
Rs. 35,40,430 and similar refund will also have to be made in respect of Ms. Indian
Telephone Industries and Hindustan Machine Tools and any other Industrial
Undertakings which may put forth such claims. Such refunds if now made would
upset the resources position of the State Government and also have an adverse
effect on the State revenue. It is therefore necessary to pass a legislation to over
602 Motor Vehicles Taxation [1957: KAR. ACT 35
come the situation arising out of the decision of the High Court to avoid the refund
of such considerable sums of money.
Hence this Bill.
(Obtained from File No. LAW. 62 LGN 78.)
XII
Amending Act 7 of 1979.—As per section 4 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicle
Taxation Act, 1957 where the tax in respect of a motor vehicle does not exceed Rs.
300 per annum it has to be paid in lumpsum once in a year. Tax payable in respect
of autorickshaws is Rs. 176 per annum. It is proposed to permit payment of tax in
respect of owner driven autorickshaws on quarterly, half-yearly or yearly basis at
the option of the owner.
Hence this Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A dated
3-2-1979, as No. 115, at page 2–3.)
XIII
Amending Act 21 of 1979.—In order to augment the revenues of the State it is
proposed to amend taxation and other laws. Opportunity is taken to make some
other amendments also.
Hence this Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A dated
27-3-1979, as No. 259, at page 43.)
XIV
Amending Act 24 of 1979.—Government have announced their decision to
abolish octroi. To compensate for the loss of revenue to Local Bodies resulting from
the abolition of octroi levy and also to provide for the developmental activities of the
State in general, it is intended to mobilise resources by revising certain existing
rates of taxes under the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act.
Hence the Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A dated
11-4-1979, as No. 328, at page 67.)
XV
Amending Act 9 of 1980.—In view of the abolition of octroi in the State,
Government increased the Motor Vehicles Tax in respect of goods vehicles by the
Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation (Second Amendment) Act 1979. Aggrieved by
this enhancement, the lorry owners in the State went on strike on 27th September
1979 to protest against the hike in the Motor Vehicles Tax. The entire issue was
reconsidered and it is decided to reduce the tax under the above Act to the previous
level with effect from 1st October 1979. Upto 31st March 1980.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A dated
5-3-1980, as No. 167, at page 5.)
1957: KAR. ACT 35] Motor Vehicles Taxation 603
XVI
Amending Act 10 of 1980.—By the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation
(Amendment) Ordinance, 1979, the rates of motor vehicles tax leviable on goods
vehicles were reduced for a period of 6 months from 1st October 1979 to 31st
March 1980.
The motor vehicles taxes are paid in respect of Transport vehicles, every
quarter. Operators of goods vehicles who have to pay tax on the 1st February or
who are required to pay before 10th March 1980 will be required, as the position
now stands, to pay tax as per the Ordinance for the months up to 31st March 1980
and taxes for subsequent months at the rates prevailing before the ordinance was
introduced. This would result in lorry operators being required to pay taxes again on
or after 1st April 1980 at rates prior to those introduced in September 1979. It would
therefore be necessary to make suitable amendments to the Karnataka Motor
Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 specifying the rates of taxes for the period subsequent
to 31st March 1980.
Hence, the Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A dated
12-3- 1980, as No. 179, at page. 5.)
XVII
Amending Act 39 of 1981.—The High Court has taken the view that the
presumption of suitability of the vehicle for use on roads did not arise when the
registration certificate of a transport vehicle is not current on account of expiry of the
fitness certificate. Certain transport operators are taking advantage of this situation
to evade payment of motor vehicle tax by allowing the fitness certificate to expire.
Section 3 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 is intended to be
amended to prevent this practice to avoid loss of revenue to the State.
The grace period for payment of tax which is now ten days is proposed to be
increased to fifteen days by amending section 4 of the Act.
Under the proviso to section 10 (f) of the Act, which was deleted in 1976, fleet
owners were entitled to proportionate reduction in the tax in respect of vehicles
which were certified as not used for a period of one calendar month or more. Since
the proviso was deleted tax has to be now paid by them even on spare vehicles
which are not under use. It is intended to restore the original position by amending
section 10 of the Act.
Collection of a fee on the issue of taxation card on vehicles operating under
reciprocal agreements has caused practical difficulties. It is intended to amend
section 10A to dispense with the collection of such fee.
It is intended that the powers of revision under section 15A should hence forth
be exercised only suo moto as now appellate powers can be exercised by the
Deputy Commissioners of Transport. Section 15A is hence intended to be
amended.
604 Motor Vehicles Taxation [1957: KAR. ACT 35
Amendments to the Karnataka Motor Vehicles are proposed in order to,
(a) Prevent vehicles with all India Tourist Permits from masquerading as stage
carriages and
(b) To provide for the developmental activities of the State by mobilising
additional resources by revising certain existing rates of taxes under the K.M.V.T.
Act 1967.
This Bill is to replace the Ordinance.

XVIII

(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A dated
27-3-1982, as No. 223, at page 42.)
XIX
Amending Act 8 of 1983.—At present there is no provision in the Karnataka
Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 for levying tax on the Private Service Vehicles. It
is considered necessary to amend the said Act since taxation in respect of omni
buses have been classified as a separate category in the said Act. The High Court
of Karnataka in Writ Appeal Nos. 413, 414 and 417–74 has observed that the
vehicles belonging to industrial undertakings cannot be issued with contract arrange
permits and the Court has suggested for suitable amendment of the Act to provide
for a separate category of permits for these vehicles. These private service vehicles
are being taxed as omnibuses at the rate of Rs. 100 percent per quarter. Hence the
Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary), PART IV—2-A dated 16-8-
1983, as No. 727, at page 4.)
XX

in tax. The Government examined their request and issued administrative
instructions to collect the tax on lorries at pre 1st April 1980 rates and the Karnataka
Motor Vehicles Taxation (Second Amendment) Act, 1980 was not given effect to. It
is therefore, necessary to ratify the action taken by the Government in issuing the
administrative instructions to the Commissioner for Transport to collect the Motor

Amending Act 23 of 2001.—In order to meet the ever increasing need of the
Bangalore City for more number of transport vehicles, the Bangalore Metropolitan
Transport Corporation has hired private buses on contract basis and operating them
as it is facing difficult financial position. According to the agreement entered into by
the Corporation with the private bus owners, it has to bear the Motor Vehicles Tax.
The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation and other transport undertakings
are paying tax as 'fleet owners' under section 10 on the gross revenue from fares
and freights of the vehicles owned by them. This concession cannot be availed in
respect of Motor Vehicles hired by them from the private bus owners as they are
liable to tax leviable under section 3. Therefore, it is considered necessary to
amend the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 to construe the State
Transport Undertakings as fleet owners even in respect of the vehicles hired by
them from private bus owners.
Certain consequential changes are also made.
Hence the Bill.

Amending Act 10 of 2007.— During the period of March 1991 to April
2000, some of the transport operators, by arriving at an arrangement with some
other companies, have paid taxes on their vehicles at a lower rate of tax though
they were required to pay the tax at higher rate as applicable to Contract
Carriages. In this connection, the Honorable High Court of Karnataka, while
disposing of the Writ Appeals in No.s 2327-28/00 and other connected matters
on 25.05.2005, made observation as follows:-
"One may say that there was a lacuna in the Taxation Act of which the
company and the contractor took advantage of and without violating any law
arrived at the aforesaid arrangement with a view to pay tax at a lower rate".
In order to remove the apparent lacuna in the Taxation Act and bring
those vehicles under appropriate entry in the Schedule to the Taxation Act, it is
expedient to amend the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 as
proposed.
Hence the Bill.

Amending Act 7 of 2010.-To give effect to the proposals made in the
Budget Speech of 2010-11, it is considered necessary to amend the Karnataka
Motor Vehicles Taxation Act 1957. (Karnataka Act No. 35 of 1957). Certain
consequential amendments have also been proposed.
Further by Act 8 of 2007, Section 15 of the Act was substituted and the
substituted section mandates that the amount disputed in the appeal shall be paid in
accordance with the order against which the appeal has been preferred. The
1957: KAR. ACT 35] Motor Vehicles Taxation 613
section does not expressly state that a proof of such payment shall accompany the
appeal, though implicitly it conveys this meaning. Due to this reason, appellants file
the appeals even without paying the disputed amount due to which the object to be
achieved by the substituted section 15 of the Act is not achieved. Hence,
Government revenue gets locked up in disputes till the dispute is finally resolved,
which may take several years. In order to safeguard the Government revenue, it is
expedient to amend section 15 of the Act. Such provisions are already present in
other taxation laws.
