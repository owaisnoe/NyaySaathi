### **1. Purpose and Overview**
[cite_start]The primary objective of this Act is to empower the Central Government to determine the conditions of service (including wages and benefits) for the officers and employees of the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL)[cite: 195].

[cite_start]The Act was enacted to ensure that the service conditions of BPCL employees are comparable to those of employees in other public sector companies, thereby preventing pay disparities within the public sector[cite: 196].

### **2. Historical Context: Why was this Act necessary?**
To understand the Act, it is essential to look at the history of BPCL's formation, which created distinct categories of employees with different pay scales.


* [cite_start]**Pre-1976:** Two separate companies existed: **Burmah Shell Refineries Limited** (refining) and **Burmah Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company** (marketing)[cite: 225].
* **1976 (Nationalization):** The government acquired Burmah Shell. [cite_start]The assets and employees were vested in the Burmah Shell Refineries, which was renamed **Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL)** [cite: 228-231].
* **The Conflict:** This merger created three categories of employees:
    1.  [cite_start]Original employees of Burmah Shell Refineries[cite: 233].
    2.  [cite_start]Employees transferred from Burmah Shell Oil Storage[cite: 234].
    3.  [cite_start]New employees recruited by BPCL after nationalization[cite: 235].

The first two categories enjoyed higher historical wages. [cite_start]The new recruits (Category 3) demanded pay parity ("equal pay for equal work"), which was supported by an Industrial Tribunal award [cite: 238-241]. [cite_start]The Government enacted this law to override that award and align BPCL wages with the general public sector wage policy, avoiding "high wage islands" [cite: 242-243].

### **3. Key Powers of the Central Government (Section 3)**
Section 3 is the core operational part of the Act. It grants the Central Government significant powers:

* [cite_start]**Framing Schemes:** The Government can frame schemes to determine the conditions of service for BPCL employees to make them comparable with other public sector companies[cite: 209].
* [cite_start]**Overriding Authority:** These schemes are valid notwithstanding the **Industrial Disputes Act, 1947**, any other laws, prior agreements, settlements, or even court decrees and tribunal orders[cite: 209].
* [cite_start]**Retrospective Effect:** The Government has the power to give these schemes retrospective effect (applying to the past)[cite: 216].
* [cite_start]**Continuance of Benefits:** The Government can decide which emoluments or benefits enjoyed by the pre-nationalization employees (Groups 1 and 2 mentioned above) will continue[cite: 211].

### **4. Parliamentary Oversight**
To ensure checks and balances, any scheme framed by the Central Government under this Act must be laid before each House of Parliament for a total period of thirty days. [cite_start]Parliament has the right to modify or annul the scheme during this period[cite: 218].

### **5. Key Definitions**
* [cite_start]**"Corporation":** Refers to the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, a Government company defined under the Companies Act, 1956[cite: 203].
* [cite_start]**"Public Sector Company":** Any corporation established by a Central Act or a Government company[cite: 208].
* [cite_start]**"Officers and Employees":** Includes those from the original Burmah Shell Refineries and those transferred from the Burmah Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company [cite: 204-207].

### **6. Repeal**
The Act replaced the **Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (Determination of Conditions of Service of Employees) Ordinance, 1988**. [cite_start]Any actions taken under that Ordinance are deemed to have been taken under this Act [cite: 221-222].
