### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Applicability and Extent (Section 2)**
* **Geographical Scope:** The Act extends to the whole of India, with the exception of territories that were formerly comprised in **Part B States** (before November 1, 1956).
* **Initial Implementation:** It was initially extended to specific regions including Uttar Pradesh, the Central Provinces, Assam, Delhi, and territories formerly in the States of Bombay, Punjab, and Ajmer.
* **State Power:** State Governments have the authority to extend the Act to other territories under their administration through official notification.

#### **2. Power to Make Rules for Loans (Section 4)**
State Governments (or Boards of Revenue/Financial Commissioners, subject to control) are empowered to create rules regarding loans. These loans are specifically intended for:
* **Relief of distress**.
* **Purchase of seed or cattle**.
* **Any other agricultural purpose** not covered by the *Land Improvement Loans Act, 1883*.
* **Transparency:** All such rules must be published in the Official Gazette and laid before the State Legislature.

#### **3. Recovery of Loans (Section 5)**
The Act provides a strict mechanism for the government to recover loans, interest, and associated costs.
* **Liability:** Both the borrower and any **surety** (guarantor) are liable for repayment.
* **Mode of Recovery:** If not paid, the loan is recoverable **as if it were an arrear of land-revenue**. This grants the government significant power to recover dues using the same machinery used for collecting land taxes.

#### **4. Joint Liability of Village Communities (Section 6)**
This section addresses loans granted to village communities or groups of borrowers.
* **Joint and Several Liability:** Members of a group can be held **jointly and severally bound** to the Government for the entire loan amount.
* **Contribution Statement:** A statement detailing exactly how much each member is bound to contribute among themselves is entered into the loan order. Once signed by the borrowers and the officer, this statement serves as **conclusive evidence** of each person's share of the liability.
