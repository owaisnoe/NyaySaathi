STATEMENTS OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
I
Act 21 of 1964.—There are at present five different enactments in force
in the five Areas of the Mysore State to regulate the constitution, powers
and jurisdiction of civil courts. It is proposed to have a uniform law on the
subject. Hence this Bill.
The following are the salient features of the Bill, namely:—
(1) provision for three classes of Civil Courts subordinate to the High
Court, namely:—
(i) the Court of the District Judge called the District Court;
3
(ii) the Court of the Civil Judge; and
(iii) the Court of the Munsiff;
(2) provision for the establishment of a District Court for each district
or more than one district and for treating the City of Bangalore as a
district;
(3) provision for the establishment of a Court of a Civil Judge for
each district; or for part of a district or for more than one district;
(4) provision for fixing and varying by the High Court with the
approval of the State Government, the number of Civil Judges and Munsiffs
to be appointed to the Court of a Civil Judge or Munsiff’s Court;
(5) provision empowering the State Government to fix the locality of
courts in consultation with the High Court;
(6) provision for treating the Courts of Civil Judges (Senior Division)
in the Bombay Area, the Courts of Civil Judges in the Mysore Area; and the
Courts of Subordinate Judges, as Courts of Civil Judges; and for treating the
Courts of Civil Judges (Junior Division) in the Bombay Area, the Courts of
District Munsifs in the Madras Area and the Courts of Munsiffs in the other
Areas, as Munsiffs’ Courts;
(7) conferment of unlimited pecuniary jurisdiction on the Court of a
Civil Judge in respect of all original suits and proceedings of a civil nature;
(8) provision for conferment of jurisdiction on the Munsiff’s Court in
respect of all suits and proceedings of a civil nature of which the amount or
value of the subject matter does not exceed five thousand rupees and on
the recommendation of the High Court, the jurisdiction of any Munsiff’s
Court may be extended by the State Government to all original suits and
proceedings of a civil nature, the value of the subject matter of which does
not exceed ten thousand rupees;
(9) provision for appeals from decrees and orders passed by a
Munsiff to the District Court; and transfer by the District Judge to the Court
of the Civil Judge within this jurisdiction of appeals the value of the subject
matter of which does not exceed five thousand rupees;
(10) provision empowering the High Court to invest any Judge of a
Court of Small Causes with powers to hear appeals from such decrees and
orders of Munsiffs’ Courts as may be referred by the District Judge;
(11) provision empowering the High Court to invest the Court of a
Civil Judge and the Court of a Munsiff with small cause powers, not

dated 7th June 1962 at page. 154–155).

II
Act 11 of 1965.—Representations have been received from the Bar
Associations in the Bombay Area requesting amendment of the Mysore Civil
Courts Act, 1964, to provide for transfer of appeals from decrees passed by
Civil Judges (Junior Division) pending before District Courts to the Courts of
Civil Judges. The High Court has also suggested amendment of the Act for
the purpose.
Hence this Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary) Part IV-2A, dated
27th March 1965, as No. 69 at page. 3.)
III
Act 81 of 1976.—According to the Civil Courts Act, 1964, appeals
from decisions of Munsiffs lie to the Courts of Civil Judges. The Civil Judges
are invested in addition, with unlimited jurisdiction in civil matters of the
value exceeding Rs. 10,000. They are also invested with trial of cases under
the Land Acquisition Act and the Hindu Marriage Act. Consequently, there is
heavy pendency in these courts.
In order that the pendency of the said appeals in reduced, and also
in order that sufficient work is provided to such of the District Courts, which
(in some Districts) have not much work, it is proposed to amend the Act and
provide that appeals from decision of Munsiffs where the value of the
subject matter is more than five thousand rupees shall lie to the District
Courts.
Small cause jurisdiction of Small Causes Judges has recently been
enhanced to Rs. 3,000. It is proposed to enhance similar jurisdiction of Civil
Judges invested with small cause powers also to Rs. 3,000.
Courts of Civil Judges are generally located in district headquarters.
It causes hardship to the litigant public to approach these courts to obtain
succession certificate until the Indian Succession Act for small sums of
money. In order to obviate this, it is proposed to empower the High Court to
invest Civil Judges, Munsiffs with this powers.
To overcome certain working difficulties experienced of making in
charge arrangements during the temperate absence of officers, and during
summer vacation, amendments are proposed to sections 25, 26 and 28.
It is also proposed to repeal the provisions relating to village courts
and nyaya panchayats under the Madras Village Courts Act, 1888, the
Mysore Village Courts Act, 1913 and the Bombay Village Panchayat Act,
1933.
5
Opportunity is taken to incorporate certain other consequential
amendments.—
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary) Part IV-2A, dated
8th November 1976 as No. 4421 at page. 7–8.)
IV
Act 8 of 1978.—Section 23 of the Karnataka Civil Courts Act, 1964
empowers the High Court to invest a Civil Judge with all or any powers of
the District Judge under several enactments. One of these is the Indian
Succession Act, 1925 (Central Act 39 of 1925). As it was felt that the power
to issue succession certificates and probates or letters of Administration
should be given to the Munsiffs also in addition to the Civil Judges, in the
interest of the litigant public residing in the moffusil areas, new section 23-A
was inserted by the section 5 or the Karnataka Civil Courts (Amendment)
Act, 1976 and as a corollary section 23 (1) (iv) of the Civil Courts Act and
section 265 and 388 of the Indian Succession Act were repealed.
The Karnataka Civil Courts (Amendment) Act, 1976 which has been
assented to by the Governor has not yet come into force. The High Court is
of the view that as the amendment Act has amended the Indian Succession
Act, it requires the assent of the President and as the same has not been
obtained the said Act is void.
State Government is of the opinion that Presidents’ assent to the
amendments is not necessary as what has been amended by sections 4
and 5 of the amendment Act is the Civil Courts Act and not the Succession
Act and omission of the provisions of the Succession Act by section 10 of
the Amendment Act is only a consequential amendment.
However, in view of High Court’s opinion and the harassment that
may result to the litigant public should the said provisions be struck down, it
is proposed to omit the said three sections 4, 5 and 10, and to bring the rest
of the provisions into force at once.
Since the Legislative Assembly was not in session an Ordinance
was promulgated. This Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary) Part IV-2A, dated
20th March 1978 as No. 276 at page. 3.)
V
Act 28 of 1978.—The Karnataka Civil Courts Act at present permits the
High Court to invest only Civil Judges with the powers of District Judges
under the Indian Succession Act. The amendments proposed by the Bill
seek to empower the High Court to invest Munsiffs too with the said powers.
A provision has also been made for appeal to the Civil Judge against the
order passed by the Munsiff and to the District Court where the order is
6
passed by a Civil Judge. The other amendments are consequential
amendments. The High Court has agreed to the proposal.
Hence the Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary) Part IV-2A, dated 1st
August 1978 as No.1098 at page. 3.)
VI
Act 13 of 1980.—City Civil Courts are functioning in the Metropolitan
Cities of Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. The High
Court is of the opinion that a City Civil Court on the pattern of the City Civil
Courts functioning in the other cities above-named may be constituted for
the City of Bangalore also. When such a City Civil Court is constituted, the
Sessions Judge will deal exclusively with criminal work and the supervision
of the work of the Magistrates’ Courts. As there will be an appeal only to the
High Court against the decision of the City Civil Court, this would not only
minimise the delay in disposal of cases but also reduce the cost of litigation.
The Government have therefore, considered it necessary to constitute a
City Civil Court for the City of Bangalore. It is also proposed to abolish
vacation in civil courts.
Hence this Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary) Part IV-2A, dated
16th May 1979 as No.473 at page. 14.)
VII
Act 11 of 1981.—In view of the heavy arrears of cases in the
Subordinate Civil Courts, it was considered necessary to increase the
number of working days of all such courts. Accordingly, the vacation to all
such courts was reduced from 60 days to 30 days by amending the relevant
provisions in the Karnataka Civil Courts Act, 1964 and the Karnataka Small
Cause Courts Act, 1964. In the Bangalore City Civil Court Act, 1979, the
duration of vacation for the City Civil Court, Bangalore City was also fixed at
30 days.
There have been a spate of representations from the various Bar
Associations in the State protesting against the reduction of vacation for
these courts and they have been requesting the Government for restoration
of vacation to the Subordinate Courts to the full period of 60 days as before.
7
Further, the subordinate Courts in the neighbouring State of Tamil Nadu,
Andhra Pradesh and Kerala have vacations during summer, winter and
Dasara totalling nearly 60 days or even more.
In view of the repealed requests from the several Bar Associations in the
State for the restoration of vacation to the full period of 60 days and in view
of the recommendation made by the High Court in this behalf, it is
considered necessary that the vacation for the Civil Courts may be restored
to 60 days, instead of 30 days, as before.
Hence the Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary) Part IV-2A, dated
28th March 1981 as No. 209 at page. 3.)
VIII
Act 26 of 1985.—With a view to provide uniform provision regarding
vacations in the Karnataka Small Cause Courts Act, 1964, the Karnataka
Civil Courts Act, 1964 and the Bangalore City Civil Courts Act, 1979, it is
considered necessary to amend the relevant sections of the said Acts.
Opportunity is also taken to make provisions for appointment of Vacation
Judges in the Karnataka Small Causes Court Act and other consequential
changes.
Hence the Bill.
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary) Part IV-2A, dated
26th July 1985 as No. 400 at page. 6.)
IX
Act 13 of 1989.—The pecuniary jurisdiction of the Courts of Munsiffs,
Courts of small causes and of District court was fixed long back, at a time
when the value of properties was far below their present value. In view of
the appreciable increase in the value of properties, more and more litigants
are forced to approach higher courts, instead of the lower courts as before,
for getting necessary reliefs.
Keeping in view the increase in the value of the properties, decrease in
rupee value and increase in banking and business activities, it is proposed
to increase the pecuniary jurisdiction of courts as follows:—
Munsiffs Courts—From Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 50,000/-
Courts of Small Causes—From Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 25,000/-
District Courts, in relation to appeals—From Rs. 20,000/- to Rs.
1,00,000/-
Hence the Bill.
8
(Published in the Karnataka Gazette (Extraordinary) Part IV-2A, dated
30th May 1988 as No. 351 at page. 4.)
X
Act 3 of 1994.—It is considered necessary to enhance the pecuniary
jurisdiction of the Civil Judges and Munsiffs, who are invested with the
jurisdiction to try suits cognizable by a Small Causes Court under Section 22
of the Karnataka Civil Courts Act, 1964, from rupees three thousand to
twenty-five thousand in the case of the Court of Civil Judges and from
rupees five hundred to three thousand in the case of Munsiff’s Court.
The Karnataka Civil Courts (Amendment) Ordinance, 1993 was
promulgated for the above purpose. This Bill seeks to replace the said
Ordinance.
Hence the Bill.
(Obtained from L A Bill No. 26 of 1993 File No. LAW 64 LGN 93.)
XI
Act 16 of 1996.—One of the directive of the Supreme Court of India, in
its judgement dated the 24th August, 1993 in the All India Judges
Association versus the Union of India and others, is to bring about uniformity
in the designations of judicial officers both in the Civil and Criminal sides.
In order to implement the decision of the Supreme Court, it is necessary
to amend the Karnataka Civil Courts Act, 1964, suitably.
Hence the Bill.
(Obtained from L A Bill No. 19 of 1996, File No. DPAL 8 LGN 96.)
XII
Amending Act 26 of 2007.—The pecuniary jurisdiction of the Courts of
Civil Judge (Junior Division), Civil Judge (Senior Division), Small Causes
Courts and District Courts and of High Court was fixed long back, at a time
when the value of the properties was far below their present value. In view
of the appreciable increase in the value of properties, litigants are forced to
approach higher courts, instead of lower courts as before, for getting
necessary reliefs.
Keeping in view the increase in the value of properties in rupee value
and increase in banking and business activities, it is proposed to increase
the pecuniary jurisdiction of courts.
Hence the Bill.
[L.A. Bill No. 34 of 2007]
[Entry 65 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.]

XIII
Amending Act 21 of 2009.- The first National Judicial Pay
Commission has requested the High Courts and State Governments/Union
Territories Administration to make necessary amendments to the term Civil
Judge (Junior Division) and Civil Judge (Senior Division) mentioned in the
respective enactments, rules, regulations, circulars etc., Therefore, it is
considered necessary to amend the Karnataka Civil Courts Act, 1964, to
implement the above recommendations.
Hence, the Bill.
(LA Bill No.28 of 2009, File No.DPAL 31 Shasana 2008)
(Entry 65 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.)
XIV
Amending Act 30 of 2015.- It is considered necessary to amend the
Karnataka Small Cause Courts Act, 1964 (Karnataka Act 11 of 1964) and
consequentially the Karnataka Civil Court Act, 1964 (Karnataka Act 21 of
1964) to provide for enhancement of pecuniary jurisdiction of the small
causes courts in the State.
Hence the Bill.
